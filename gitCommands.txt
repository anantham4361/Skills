To add new files to your GitHub repository after the initial push, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to Your Repository
Ensure you're in the repository directory on your local machine:
bash
cd <repository_name>

2. Add the New Files
Check the current status to see the new files:
bash
git status
bash
git add <file_name>

To add all new files (and changes to existing files), use:
bash
git add .

3. Commit the Changes
Commit the newly added files with a meaningful commit message:

bash
git commit -m "<message here>"

4. Push the Changes to GitHub
Push the new commit to the remote repository:
bash
git push origin <branch_name>

5. Verify on GitHub
Go to your GitHub repository in your web browser to confirm the new files are uploaded.

Example

Bash Commands
cd my-repo
git status
git add file1.txt file2.py
git commit -m "Added file1.txt and file2.py"
git push origin main
